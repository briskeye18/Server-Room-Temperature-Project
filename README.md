# Server-Room-Temperature-Project
The server room at my school was reaching unacceptable levels. Its thermostat controlled other rooms so you could not just lower it to a reasonable temp. This project was to graph the data taken from a TMP 36 sensor and using a Huzzah esp8266 to convert and trasmit the data to a remote server.
The first problem run into was when attempting to receive the data from the temperature sensor. The problem was that the temperature sensor took 5 volts to read the sensor so our math was off. I learned that the Huzzah only puts out 3.3 volts from its one analog read pin so a few adjustments to our math to accomadate for the less voltage running throught the temperature sensor
